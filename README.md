## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- JavaScript

### What I learned

This is my fifth Frontend Mentor challenge, my second with JavaScript. Quite frankly, the Javascript wasn't a problem at all, but the CSS was really rough for me this time around. I definitely struggled with figuring out how to hide the overflow of some images, while keeping it visible for others. I definitely could've sat here all night and kept trying random solutions in hopes that something would stick, but I knew that I had reached the point where I wasn't actually learning anymore. Any solution I might've located would've been quickly forgotten during future projects. I may come back to it later and give it another go, though.

### Continued development

I think my biggest challenge with this project was that I designed for mobile first, which I've never done before. This certainly opened my eyes to how much I have to learn when it comes to designing for mobile, and how I need to learn to visualize it on its own instead of just imagining it as a smaller version of desktop.
